# SpeechRecognition

Objective: Develop a high-performance, noise-robust speech command recognition system. The system will recognize speech commands in real-time and deploy on a resource-constrained device (e.g., Raspberry Pi). Multi-language support can be added as an enhancement and will provide bonus points.

Tools and Libraries:

Framework: TensorFlow or PyTorch
Dataset: Google Speech Commands Dataset (with noise-added variants)
Programming Language: Python
Deployment: TensorFlow Lite or ONNX for edge devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi)
Preprocessing: Librosa, SoX
Hardware : Raspberry Pi or NVIDIA Jetson Nano
